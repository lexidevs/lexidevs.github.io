title: the year of the linux desktop 
---

Or something like that. For years, there's been an ongoing joke that the next year will be the "year of the Linux desktop" for one reason or another.
Of course, the prophecy has never come true. As of the writing of this article, the worldwide desktop market share of Linux is a whopping 3.9%. If you 
include Chrome OS (which is based on Linux, and can run Linux apps), that goes up to a whopping 4.92%. That... is not much. Windows, for better or (more likely)
worse, is still king.

I think it's very unlikely that a mass exodus from Windows to Linux will happen in the near future, absent some massively unpopular decision by Microsoft.
The biggest reason for this, I believe, is the difficulty of installing and using Linux as a desktop OS for most people. Sure, for techie people,
installing an operating system isn't difficult. But most people have never reinstalled Windows, and the sight of a terminal terrifies them.
Most laptops come pre-installed with Windows and only Windows. Some manufaturers are now offering certain laptops with Linux distributions installed,
but chances are, if you buy a laptop, it will have Windows, or it will be a Mac. 

Further, while I believe there are plenty of good reasons to switch to Linux (configurability, privacy, lack of bloatware... they go on), the statistics
clearly show that the perceived benefits from switching don't outweigh the perceived costs.

Okay, so, if more people are going to use Linux, what needs to happen? 
1. **Linux needs to be easy. Like, really easy. And cohesive.** One of the big problems with desktop Linux, for most people, is the inability to 
do what they need to do from a GUI. For now, most people don't want to use a command line. And asking users to learn a whole new way of interacting
with their computers is only going to reduce the number of users who switch. Depending on your distribution and DE, certain system administration tasks
can be done with a GUI... but often not everything, and there certainly isn't one place to go to configure everything. That needs to change.

2. **Apps need to be available for Linux.** This is sort of a chicken-and-egg problem: developers won't distribute their apps for Linux because there
aren't enough users, and people won't use Linux because their apps aren't available. However, I feel like this may be changing. An increasing number of
apps are web apps -- a change I dislike, but I'll get into that in another post -- so it doesn't really matter what desktop operating system you're
using. For other apps, they need to have a Linux build, *and* they need to have a easy, graphical way of installing it. Asking people to download a
gzipped tarball and extract it to their system will alienate most users.

3. **There needs to be a reason to switch.** As we've seen, people won't switch unprompted. If a large number of users are going to switch from Windows
to Linux, there needs to be a reason to leave. This is either a benefit of Linux that Windows doesn't offer, or a downside of Windows. It's possible that
the destructive wave of generative "AI" and Microsoft "Copilot" will lead people to leave, but I'm not sure. 

I don't know if, or when, these things will happen. But if the year of the Linux desktop is going to next 5, 10, 15 or 20 years, I think they will need
to happen.
